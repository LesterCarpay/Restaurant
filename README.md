A small project to implement the back-end of a simple restaurant management app. 
It mainly serves for practice of Go and databases.

A [tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-simple-app-go-postgresql/) about how to implement a simple to-do list formed the basis of the project.
The complexity was increased by focusing on restaurants rather than a to-do list and interface was changed from a web page to the terminal.
